## Session 1: May 18, 2025 - Beginning
**_Hours Spent: 3_**

Every project needs to start somewhere, I have been wanting to mess with the 6502 microcontroller for a while now, and I wanted to expand my hardware experience as well as improve my assembly skills since I started making games for the [GameBoy](https://github.com/GalaxyGamingBoy/gb-flappy).

The original project idea was spontaneous and originated as a challenge to use a limiting chip that powered hundred of well-known devices, the 6502, in the modern age where tiny and powerful chips like the RP2040 dominate. 

The current chips I definitely plan to have are:

|   Chip/Name    |                                 Description                                  | Quantity |
| :------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :------: |
| W65C02S6TPG-14 |          The actual W6502S chip, the brains of the microcontroller           |    1     |
| W65C22S6TPG-14 | The Versatile Interface Adapter of the W6502S, basically handles latched I/O |    2     |
| 256KiB EEPROM  |               The Location where the binary will be read from                |    1     |
|   64 KiB RAM   |                           The General Work RAM[^1]                           |    1     |
[^1]: Actual RAM size TBD

As for the EEPROM, I'll need to make a cheap EEPROM programmer, that turns out to not be that hard with the correct [chips](https://eu.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Texas-Instruments/SN74LS164NE4?qs=SL3LIuy2dWzMustM9SNFlQ%3D%3D), however more research is always needed. A nice to have for the board would be USB-C power.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The clock speed of the 6502 is To Be Determined at a later date and will be chosen accordingly to make sure the timings on the RAM are sufficient

## Session 2: May 19, 2025 - The start of the Schematic
**_Hours Spent: 5_**

The main focus on today has mostly been documentation and putting a start on the PCB design. I focused on connecting the 2 fundamental parts of the project, the W65C02, which is the controller, to the W65C22, the Versatile Interface Adapter. Below is how the schematic is currently looking as well as a brief description on each component

![Journal Image 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GalaxyGamingBoy/6502-Microcontroller/refs/heads/main/imgs/journal/j-1.svg)
| Component            | Description                                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| W65C02               | The main chip, exposes the R/W pin, Data Bus and Address Bus for the other Components                              |
| VIA1                 | The first Versatile Interface Adapter for I/O operations. Exposes both ports on the VIA0_P bus                     |
| Decoupling Caps      | Stabilizes Power Supply Voltage, one cap for each IC                                                               |
| PWR PINS<br>VIA1 Pin | The header to expose the power to the future PCB                                                                   |
| PWR TGL              | The toggle switch for the power, defaults to disabled via a pull-down resistor                                     |
| OSCILLATOR           | Provides a clock signal for the ICs, Frequency is TBD but I'll start with 1MHz                                     |
| RESET BTN            | Allows for manual operation resets via bridging the ground voltage to the W65C02                                   |
| I/O Address Matching | Handles the chip select signal for the VIA. Currently the VIA is taking up the whole 0x4000 - 0x8000 memory block. |

The first drafts of the memory map have also been started, here is the current plan

| From   | To     | Usage          |
| ------ | ------ | -------------- |
| 0x0000 | 0x4000 | RAM[^2]        |
| 0x4000 | 0x8000 | I/O Operations |
| 0x8000 | 0xFFFF | ROM[^3]        |
[^2]: To Be Determined at a later date
[^3]: Subject to change but most likely will remain the same

> [!NOTE]  
> The memory map still needs a lot of work but I am for maximum efficiency on both ROM and RAM while keeping costs low.

So far so good, the documentation has been a non issue and is rather well written. The architecture is very simple to which makes it easier to implement than depend on already made solutions. 

## Session 3: May 20, 2025 - EEPROM & SRAM
**_Hours Spent: 4_**

Today is a pretty light but fundamental day on designing the schematic. This is the first introduction of the SRAM and EEPROM modules, the RAM and ROM of our controller. 

Here is a schematic of how they are connected  
<img width="466" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-22 at 8 10 17 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6f8587e-6c37-4fe2-9fa1-e06b75b759bd" />


> [!NOTE]
> This schematic showcases a different memory mapping than the original that was switched on the 4th Session

The A0-A15 pins are directly connected to the 65C02 address bus while the `DQ0`-`DQ7` and `I/O0`-`I/O7` are connected to the data bus. The important thing to note here are the Chip Select and Chip Enable logic for the SRAM and EEPROM.

### Timings - EEPROM
The EEPROM Iâ€™m using, the AT28C256, has a read access time of 150ns. According to the 65C02 datasheet, the address setup time is 30ns. This means the total minimum delay for a read operation is around 180ns. Additionally, the logic gates involved introduce a worst-case propagation delay of 25ns each, resulting in a total of 50ns delay for the Chip Select signal to propagate through the logic circuitry.

That limits our clock speed to 4,3478MHz at the worst possible outcome

<img width="699" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-22 at 8 15 58 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58a48617-7c81-4451-9db6-5460c57210ac" />  
<p style="text-align:center;">  
Figure: W65C02 timing diagram
</p>  

> [!warning] 
> The above times is only a guesstimate, don't take it for granted and I am not going through part of the R/W flow to discuss every delay

### Timings - SRAM
The SRAM module I'm using, the AS6C6225, has a read/write delay of approximately 55ns. Accounting for logic gate delays at worst environmental factors, which are again ~50ns, we can measure and confirm if our SRAM module is compatible with the controller.

The read part seems to be in line with what we expect, plenty of time for the clock and the read to happen. Now onto the write part, the other crucial part of why we need a RAM module.

Upon closer inspect to the write characteristics and timing cycle diagram we can spot a potential issue.
<img width="576" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-22 at 8 26 56 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95f8e9e5-59e9-4a55-b4fa-358a9acd89cb" />  
<img width="657" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-22 at 8 24 49 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7bb2c41-b74f-433f-a4e0-3056bbf56948" />  
<p style="text-align:center;">
Figure: AS6C6225 Timing Table
</p>

The address can be invalidated before the write happens, meaning that there is a chance to write data in an unknown place in RAM and corrupt it. The recommended solution for this according to many forum posts and other designs from 6502.org many choose to tie the SRAM Clock Enable pin to the clock so it only write and stops writing before the address changes, The address hold time in this case is 10ns.

With that in consideration we have landed in this clock chip arrangement

## Session 4: May 21, 2025 - Memory Rework, PD, Crystal, IO, ACIA, EEPROM Programmer
**_Hours Spent: 6_**

Lots of changes today on the schematic, first and foremost I discovered and spend a lot of time reading the [6502 Primer](https://wilsonminesco.com/6502primer/), which has been a massive help.

A lot of time today was spent trying to figure out not intutive and cross checking that the SRAM timings work fine. I also spent a lot of time researching the correct footprints from LCSC that I will need to have in order to begin the design of the PCB module.

The most important change for today is the reworked memory map which priorities RAM space than ROM space. As such after a lot of research and brainstorming the most optimal ways to get the best of both worlds I had 3 viable solutions.

- Use a multiplexer IC
- Use a 6502 ready address IC
- Make a custom combination by arranging the logic gates in different ways

Avoiding cost and wanting to do it myself I opted for the 3rd option and switched the logic gates in a way so we have more ram and less rom, as I view wram being more important especially when comparated to the relative efficient assembly rom that will be put.


Here is a map of the new memory space:

| From   | To     | Usage |
| ------ | ------ | ----- |
| 0x0000 | 0x7FFF | SRAM  |
| 0x8400 | 0x87FF | ACIA1 |
| 0x8800 | 0x8FFF | ACIA0 |
| 0x9000 | 0x9FFF | VIA1  |
| 0xA000 | 0xBFFF | VIA0  |
| 0xC000 | 0xFFFF | ROM   |

And the specs:
+ 16 KiB of ROM
+ 32 KiB of RAM

![6502Microcontroller-MemoryMatching](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1026305-0e8b-4404-b3d2-0270763e7448)

Another thing I wanted to tackle today are the I/O ports and expansion slots, as such I hooked up both the VIA's and ACIA's pins to headers on the board. I also exposed the power pins and interrupt handlers. Last thing to note is the addition of a header of rows that expand a modular interface of the address and data lines of the 6502 for further expansion using flex cables. [^4]

![6502Microcontroller-Connectors](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f69c4ec-c515-42b1-9590-a8189b178e3d)

The board will also contain a EEPROM Programmer controlled by a RPI pico using [picoprom](github.com/gfoot/picoprom?tab=readme-ov-file)

![6502Microcontroller-EEPROM Programmer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bccf6e8-ed48-4551-a2f5-5b70a78e0b51)

The final board revision will contain 2x VIAs and 2x ACIAs for a lot of I/O opportunities and serial.

> [!info] 
> A cool feature I will try to implement is on the fly program execution using serial

![6502Microcontroller-IO](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5fef0bb-743d-4e72-83b9-a8dff2bd747e)

Now for the main board design, I've also added a USB-C & DC Barrel Jack power source. For the Interrupts I have exposed a header that using jumper cables one will be able to select where the interrupt gets chosen from. Last thing to note is that the crystal oscillator now exposes a header for override the board oscillator with an external oscillator if needed, controlled via the tristate pin

## Session 5: May 22, 2025 - Schematic Polishing, Decoupling Capacitors
**_Hours Spent: 5_**

Today was a lot of important progress on polishing the kicad schematics and adding all the needed capacitors as well as a voltage step down converter for the DC Barrel Jack.

Before this moment I haven't checked the Electric Rule Checker at all, and after I did I was in for a shock. At least 100+ violations of `Bus graphically connected but is not a member of that bus`. Hmm that was a bit suspicious, last time I used KiCad buses I never got that error

After a bit of investigation work, [this](https://forum.kicad.info/t/solved-bus-graphically-connected-but-is-not-a-member-of-that-bus/39761/2) forum post clued me in to what was happening. Since the last time I used KiCad buses was a while ago on an older version for platform control the buses on the newer kicad version were updated. After painstakingly rerouting all of the schematic wire I was still getting bus violations, but to duplicate entries?

After a lot of head scratching the issue was my bus alias definitions, it turns out the nested bus names also act as local/global variables to the schematic. Oops...

I've also spend some time today on assigning proper footprints and getting the necessary LCSC footprint parts to every component, that process was very time consuming because I had to export every easyeda part by hand. Thankfully, or not, I decided to use the included DIP Socket footprints of KiCad thinking that they were going to work okay.

## Session 6: May 23, 2025 - First PCB Draft Revision, Fail?
**_Hours Spent: 6_**

Today I started routing the first PCB routing draft, I started of with 2 layers, one signal and the other primarily a ground plane. I capped myself the PCB at `100mm x 100mm`.

Upon loading all the components I noticed that a lot of them take much more space than originally realized and that I will have to make them a snug fit, but leaving that worry to future me. Firstly I started wiring the ROM chip to the W65C02 while making sure the 4MHz crystal oscillator was close enough. 

![PCB](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ffde01d-48e4-4aed-b64e-ce7dfb6f186f)

Hm, that doesn't look quite right, I was leaving space in the middle for all the data pins and GPIO signals that work so they don't crosstalk that much. Quickly I realized the waste of space orienting the ICs like that would have on the board and I decided to opt for another design that preserves much more space and makes the address and data pins have similar widths to prevent incorrect memory access later, or reach race conditions

![PCB](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9290d04b-4e4f-4acf-90c1-b4abafde45ff)

That seems much better but it still has some bends, angles and via's that I would like to avoid. The usage of via's in the middle in the start like that also provide worst problems later down when I try to connect everything and squeeze as much space I can get out of this thing.

Although I still continued to route as much as I was able to put down.

Halfway through I realized that the crystal oscillator that I used for the W65C02 was not available at the size and frequency that I want but I left that for the next session to figure out.

## Session 7: May 24, 2025 - 3rd PCB Revision
**_Hours Spent: 7_**

Today I redid the PCB again, I was not ultimately that happy with the distance between the chips and chose to redo the design of he board again. This time with 4 layers and them being stacked like this:

1. Top Layer (Signals)
2. In1 Copper Layer - Ground Plane (GND)
3. In2 Copper Layer - Power Plane (+5V)
4. Bottom Layer (Signals)

I chose this layer setup to provide the optimal chance to minimize crosstalk and provide the most optimal routing.  

Routing everything was going really well until I had to connect the IC8 and IC6 parts, in this case the ACIA ICs, that was when everything started to be a lot harder. I had to use a few more via's than I would like but in the end everything was connected and that's what mattered. I tried to keep clear of possible points of cross talk and nearly the same amount of vias to every IC chip to minimize longer paths with more resistances. Other than that here is the design I nailed down.

![PCB R3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71372f29-883f-4c79-a790-cd750853219e)

Session 8: May 25, 2025 - CAD
**_Hours Spent: 7_**

Ultimately I was quite happy with how the PCB turned out, even tho everything is a tight fit. That means the next step for the project is the CAD, I also wanted to take a break from PCB design, considering I stayed up quite late so I could finish it 

For the CAD I have 2 choices of software to use
1. FreeCAD
2. Onshape

However considering the convenience of Onshape being all online, I decided to choose that over FreeCad.

After a lot of brainstorming both on paper and draw.io I came up for the following parts that I would like the CAD project to have.

1. PCB Frame, holds the PCB in place and prevents accidental contact with the PCB layers to prevent scratching and other surface damage
2. Case, Covers the frame to prevent the ICs from being handled incorrectly and prevents the potential of ESD Damage

> [!warning] 
> CMOS chips like the W65C02 are very sensitive to ESD damage so we need to be very caution with the handling of the chips

I decided to do the PCB frame larger than needed and add a seperate 3D printed part as a filler so I can sand it down if the clearance got too tight

All that considered here is the frame and case drawing

## Session 9: May 26 - Schematic Review, Schematic, PCB review and Fixing DRC issues
**_Hours Spent: 4_**

Woah, new session! It will mostly be spent on cleanup of the schematics and cad[^5]
[^5]: And new CAD part :)

While analyzing the schematic I realized I never added the voltage step down from 12V to 5V, that could have been bad... Well here it is:

<img width="233" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-28 at 7 21 13 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/265fc03b-8821-4e7e-9d22-9af783ca0ad1" />


I had to design my own symbol for it but that wasn't that bad, KiCad is really nice with working on actually. 

For the PCB I noticed that some components were misaligned so I aligned them and added some symbols and footprints with information like the memory layout of the board. Neat!

As for the CAD I added a new extension board for the frame, it has a place for a motherboard for easy access and provides a stable surface to work and carry. Onshape is exceeding my expectations really quickly, it really is an amazing tool to use

![Microcontroller Holder Drawing 6502-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb13a1ff-5afe-40ee-9182-8cb7ce6535ce)

Session 10: May 27 - LCSC Part Review, fiting in PCB, Footprints and BOM
**_Hours Spent: 4_**

After reviewing the footprints I realized I made a glaring issue with the built-in footprints. I turns out LCSC has the footprints in a 90 degree offset, leading to them being wrong in the PCB construction. To fix that I will again manually change update the footprint one part of the time, align it back to the proper place and fix the 10+ DRC violations due to track collisions or tracks being connected accidentally.

The same issue happened with the Pin Header, here is the JLCPCB part assembly preview to visualize the problem better

<img width="661" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-28 at 7 43 13 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b07ec4cb-604c-46dd-b25c-2e6f99966024" />

I also found a solution to the crystal that I needed and LCSC didn't stock. I found a matching through hole crystal in mouser that I can manually solder by myself. For that I moved the pads to the back left edge of the board so I can't risk any of the more critical components being damaged. To avoid further PCB damage too I will add kaptop tape to the areas at risk 

Last things for this session I added more informative silkscreen on the board and checked the clearance one more time.

## Session 11: May 28 - CA65, Project Template, Build System
**_Hours Spent: 2_**

I'm really happy with the progress of the project so far, today I did more code stuff by doing a sample project that can be compiled and used on the board so I can do testing when I have the actual boards. Here is how I have the code project setup so far

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile   # Used to configure the building
â”œâ”€â”€ gpmc.cfg   # The CA65 linker file to declare segments
â”œâ”€â”€ gpmc.inc   # Helper include which contains the I/O mappings
â”œâ”€â”€ src        
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.s # The main program
â”œâ”€â”€ startup.s  # Contains the startup logic
â””â”€â”€ vectors.s  # Adds the code vectors to the ROM
```

Configuring CA65 was not that hard, making the Makefile took more time. Here is the linker script I decided to end up with the following configuration and segments (explanation below)

```txt
MEMORY {
    ZP:        start =    $0, size =  $100, type   = rw, define = yes;
    RAM:       start =  $200, size = $7E00, define = yes;
    ROM:       start = $C000, size = $4000, type   = ro, file   = %O;
}

SEGMENTS {
    ZEROPAGE: load = ZP,  type = zp,  define   = yes;
    BSS:      load = RAM, type = bss, define   = yes;
    STARTUP:  load = ROM, type = ro;
    CODE:     load = ROM, type = ro;
    RODATA:   load = ROM, type = ro;
    VECTORS:  load = ROM, type = ro,  start    = $FFFA;
}

[...]
```

| Segment  | Usage                      |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| ZEROPAGE | Fast access RAM            |
| BSS      | Normal Work RAM            |
| STARTUP  | Contains startup logic     |
| CODE     | Well, the code             |
| RODATA   | Read Only Data, ie strings |
| VECTORS  | Vectors in memory, ie IRQ  |
As for the makefile I ended up with the following commands
+ `make all` - Builds the main ROM file
+ `make clean` - Cleans the directory of build artifacts

The most interesting part of the `Makefile` to point out would be the creation of the actual binary file due to the way we have setup our memory config. Currently ROM gets enabled when both A15 and A14 bits get triggered, that means our sequence always starts with `11(...)`

However the EEPROM takes in A0-A14 bits, meaning our memory locations are always with an offset of `0x4000` in hex or `16384` in decimal. That we must prepend `16384` bytes to the flash file before we can use, else we will read invalid addresses. Thus this gives us the following command:
```sh
	dd if=/dev/zero bs=16384 count=1 2>/dev/null | cat - $(name).out > $(name).bin
```
