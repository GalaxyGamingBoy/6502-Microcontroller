# General Purpose 6502 Microcontroller

This is about a general purpose microcontroller, like the arduino, but using the 65C02 IC. The 6502 powered microcontroller unit that has 32KiB of RAM and 16KiB of storage and runs with 4MHz.

## Why?
Ever wanted to use the Apple I or NES like an Arduino? The one thing in common with both of these platforms is the 8-bit processor known as the 6502 or itâ€™s modern cousin the W65C02S. I was always fascinated by the multiple features it has even as such an old microprocessor. Thus I decided to build my own 6502 powered microcontroller that is inspired by this

## Features

- 32 GPIO Pins
- 16 KiB of EEPROM Storage
- 32 KiB RAM
- 2x Serial Interface
